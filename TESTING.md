## Testing Room Creation and Joining

### Prerequisites
- Make sure your server is running: `npm run start-server`
- Make sure your client is running: `npm run dev`
- Make sure your Supabase database tables are created

### Test 1: Create a Room

1. **Open your browser** and go to: http://localhost:5173
2. **Click "Create New Room"**
3. **Expected Results:**
   - You should see a room code generated (e.g., ABC123)
   - The room code should be displayed prominently in the chat header
   - You should automatically join the room
   - You should see the chat interface
   - Check the browser console for success messages

### Test 2: Join an Existing Room

1. **Open a new browser tab/window** (or use incognito mode)
2. **Go to:** http://localhost:5173
3. **Enter the room code** from Test 1 in the input field
4. **Click "Join Room"**
5. **Expected Results:**
   - You should join the same room
   - You should see the chat interface
   - You should see the other user in the active users list
   - Check the browser console for success messages

### Test 3: Multiple Users in Same Room

1. **Open 3-4 different browser tabs/windows**
2. **Join the same room** using the room code
3. **Send messages** from different users
4. **Expected Results:**
   - All users should see messages from each other
   - Active users list should show all users
   - Typing indicators should work

### Test 4: Room Code Sharing

1. **Create a room** in one browser
2. **Copy the room code** by clicking on it
3. **Paste the code** in another browser
4. **Join the room**
5. **Expected Results:**
   - Room code should be copyable
   - Joining should work with the copied code

## Debugging

### Check Browser Console
Open Developer Tools (F12) and check the console for:
- ‚úÖ Success messages
- ‚ùå Error messages
- üì° Socket connection status

### Check Server Console
Look at your server terminal for:
- ‚úÖ "Room created: [CODE] (DB & In-memory)"
- ‚úÖ "User joined room: [CODE]"
- ‚úÖ "Message in [CODE] from [USER] (Persisted to DB)"
